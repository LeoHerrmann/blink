## Description

Prototype of an Android app for a grocery shopping service.

This project was realized as a part of the course "Human Computer Interaction" at Hochschule Darmstadt. Our task was to implement a given set of features. These features do not have to be fully functional. Instead we were asked to focus on high quality user experience.

This prototype supports three types of users:
- customers browse the products and place orders
- providers manage the products and pick-up orders
- deliverers manage delivery orders

## Visuals

Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Usage

When the app is started, a login mask opens. The entered username determines which part of the app you will see. Type
- "deliverer" to login as a deliverer
- the name of a provider such as Lidl, Rewe, Netto, ... to login as a provider
- any other name to login as a customer

Feel free to play around :)
